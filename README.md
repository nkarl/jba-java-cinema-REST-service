## [JBA-Jv] Cinema Room REST Service

Let's get back to the basics!

I am starting this Java project after having played around with a few different languages for the past couple weeks (Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).  I had been trying to pick up Java rapidly and was quickly tired out by Java's verbosity, coming from Python just prior to that.  I thought my mind was feeling saturated from the sudden influx of verbosity so I needed a break from Java.  I spent the next two weeks playing around with Haskell (which I knew previously), and picking up on Scala and Kotlin.  The latter two helped me prepare myself to integrate better with the Java ecosystem.  After two weeks, I thought it is a good time now to get back and take on a complete project in Java.  In other words, I have finally finished going through the *Five Stages of Grief* and now ready to work with Java! (hopefully)

### Project Description 
> Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like?  You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets?  Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that!  Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue.  Pass me the popcorn, please!


### Learning Outcomes
> In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.

*Note to myself:* 
```
My goal for taking on this project is to get more experienced and learn more about client-server model.  I have a rough idea of this model but severely lack concrete use case to solidify the idea into an understanding.  I hope to achieve that at the end of this project.
